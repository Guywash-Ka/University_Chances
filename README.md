The web-app allows user to get the _"real"_ chances of getting to Rostov university and take a short test to get your score. The service includes registration or authorization and the main page, which gives the results judging by the input points.

### Technologies
I used **Flask framework** as it is an easy and efficient way to start a project on your own computer.

### Usage
First, you must be sure you have all the libs:

    pip3 install flask
    pip3 install flask-login
    pip3 install flask-form
    pip3 install sqlalchemy
    pip3 install wtforms
Clone repository:
    
    git clone https://github.com/Guywash-Ka/University_chances.git
To start the project on your _localhost_:

    python3 main.py
And open your _localhost_ in browser(http://127.0.0.1:8080)
